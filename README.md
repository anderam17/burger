## Description
    This app allows you to enter the names of delicious burgers and allows you to devour them! Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Each burger, devoured or not, is stored in a database using MySQL. This app uses HTML, CSS, MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. 

## Usage Instructions
